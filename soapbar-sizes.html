		<h3><i class="bi bi-dash"></i>Deciding the Size and Dimenions<i class="bi bi-dash"></i></h3>

		<p class="lead">We have covered the Types of Soap Bars, The Shapes of Soap Bars, Styling of Soap Bars, and lastly discussing
			the Weight and dimensions of each type of soap bar.</p>

		<p class="lead">So, let's get started.</p>

		<h4>Standard Bar, Beauty Bar, Hand or Face Bar</h4>

		<p>The standard soap bar is 3 inches in length, 2inches in width, and one-inch in thickness. The standard
			soap bar contains 6 cubic inches of soap and weighs three ounces. Its size and weight are ideal as it fits
			neatly into the palm of the hand. It has great gripping properties.</P>

		<h4>Bath Bar, Family Bar, Industrical, Commercial, Pet Bar</h4>

		<p>The bath soap is larger, measuring 4 to 5 inches in length, 3 inches in width, and 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 inches in
			thickness. These bars contain approximately 200 cubic inches of soap and weight 6 to 8 ounces.<br /><br />
			Because this larger bar size is harder to hold, a face cloth is usually used to grip this soap bar.
			This soap bar is also known as the laundry bar when laundry was done using a scrub board and rinse water.
			Today, this size of soap bar is used as an industrial soap bar, a pet bar, even a livestock bar.</p>

		<h4>Guest Bar, Hotel Bar, Sampler Bar</h4>

		<p>The guest soap is the smallest size, measuring 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 to 2 inches and three-eighths of an inch thick
			and weigh ½ an ounce to one ounce. The guest soap contains enough useful soap for an over-night or
			short stay.<br /><br /> Today, this guest soap size and weight are used as samplers – samples of your soap --
			to let your customers know what to expect. You can offer your sampler bars as a give-away; however, most soap
			makers do charge for their samplers with proceeds going to a local charity or hospital. You can promote
			your soap bar with local Bed and Breakfasts. This smaller size makes excellent aromatic bath frizzies which
			dissolve quickly releasing your perfect sense.</p>

		<h4>Finally …</h4>

		<h4>Advertising The Soap Bar Weight<br /> Product Labelling Has Regulations.</h4>


		<p>When a product is labelled, it must have, at least, the net weight on the package, say ninety grams; the word
			'soap' to identify the contents; along with an identifying name of a fragrance; and the name and the address
			of the business. <br /><br />Should the soap bar weigh a little more than what the package says, that is
			acceptable to the labelling laws and FDA regulations. It is when the contents weigh less than the weight on the
			label, the company will face fines. As we all know, it is a priority to get as close to the weight as we can
			without being under the labelled weight, but not ‘so much’ more as it costs more to manufacture the soap bar.
			<br /><br />Technically, you do not have to list the ingredients. You must label it "SOAP"; how much it weighs;
			and where to find your company.<br /><br /> You can list fragrance as just "fragrance", or "fragrances". You can
			list any ingredients that are less than one percent of the total formula, in any order, at the end of the list of
			ingredients.<br /><br />
			In the United States, Acts and Regulations are governed by the FDA (Food & Drug Administration) and the FTC
			(Federal Trade Commission). The Acts include Federal Food, Drug & Cosmetic Act, Fair Packaging & Labelling Act
			<br /><br />In Canada, Acts and Regulations are governed by Health Canada and the Competition Bureau. The Acts
			include Food & Drugs Act, Cosmetic Regulations, Consumer Packaging and Labelling Act & Regulations, Hazardous
			Products Act, Consumer Chemicals and Containers Regulations.
